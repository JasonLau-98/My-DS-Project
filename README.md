# Data science project
My data science projects will be saved here!

**Story about my first project:**
<br>Wine.ipynb is my first data science project, which is about classification of wine quality.
<br>The reason I would like to start working on this data science project especially this project is that I actually like drinking (haha).
<br>When I started my project, I tried to apply the skills and techniques I learnt from Coursera, and aimed to build a model with the highest accuracy as possible.
<br>I tried to work in several ways to improve the accuracy. Though it might not always work, I can still learn a lot from it.

I really enjoy the time working on my first project!!
