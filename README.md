[Wine.ipynb](https://github.com/JasonLau-98/My-DS-Project/blob/main/Wine.ipynb)
<br>Wine.ipynb is my first data science project, which is about classification of wine quality using Python.
<br>When I started my project, I tried to apply the skills and techniques I learnt from Coursera as listed below:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data wrangling
- Data engineering
- Machine learning modeling
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation
